This project created to develop my own blog. Making my own blog instead of using a template or a ready made site is an attempt to understand web development more. Personally, I have never been too interested in web development but I see immense value in having the ability to hand craft a website that is accessible to anyone around the world. The purpose of this blog was originally post my LeetCode solutions/personal projects as a way to document my studying/findings. This way I gain a better understanding and someone who visits my site will (hopefully) learn something.

## The Website

This **SSR** website is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). If you would like to visit this website click [here](https://www.alexsikorski.net/).

## Technologies

- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/)

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

*Note: to view dependencies view [package.json](package.json).*

## Setup

*Note: to set up your content management system to match mine would be a nightmare since I have deviated from the original tutorial linked in references significantly.*

Create .env file in root directory in this format:

```NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHCMS_ENDPOINT=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx```

```GRAPHCMS_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx```
